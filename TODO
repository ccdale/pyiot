make a synthetic switch
that can be queried for it's state
and can have it's state changed.

the switch needs to respond to 2 commands

    state: tell me whether it is on or off
    switch: switch to the other state

while the switch command is active all other switch commands should be ignored.

Listener: write tests to test listen function
